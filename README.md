* 01-Sine -> Your first oscillator. How to generate a sine wave using ofxMaxiOsc.
* 02-FFT -> visualization of different sound waves in time domain and frequency domain.
* 03-FFT-File -> Spectrum analysis on a loaded file.
* 04-FFT-AudioIn -> Spectrum analysis on Audio Input.
* 05-frequency-modulator -> FFT visualization of how a wave can modulate the frequency of another wave.
* 06-RMS -> a good approximation of loudness.
* 07-beatDetection -> Beat detection based on RMS, not multi-band.
* 09-Filters -> Low res filter example, easy adaptable to the other filters.

Note: some of the examples requires an audio wav files in order to work, the file is not included. Add it into `bin/data` and name it `beat.wav`
